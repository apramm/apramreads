# Daily Reading - January 15, 2024

## Two Pages Challenge

Today I continued with my 2 pages a day challenge. I'm reading a book on productivity.

### What I Read Today

Pages 42-43 covered the importance of morning routines. The author suggests:

- Wake up at the same time every day
- Start with something you enjoy
- Avoid checking your phone immediately

### Reflection

These tips seem simple but powerful. I'm going to try implementing the "no phone first thing" rule starting tomorrow.
