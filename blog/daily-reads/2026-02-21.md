# Day 14 : Feb 21, 2026

## Two Pages Challenge

This is not related to the compiler book its about Algorithm Design book. We reading the Chapter 7 : Network Algorithms.

### What I Read Today

- matching
    - matching in a graph G=(V, E) is a set of edges M ⊆ E with the property that each node
appears in **at most one edge of M** 
    - A set of edges M is a perfect matching if
every node appears in **exactly one edge of M**

- bipartite matching, matchings in bipartite graph can model situations in which **objects are being assigned to other objects**
    - X rep jobs and Y rep machines and edge (x_i, y_j) indicates the machine y_j is capable of performing job x_i
    - can also show relation between customer and stores; houses and nearby fire stations and so forth

- Lemma : G has a perfect matching iff |X| = |Y| and it has a maching size of |X|

- **determining largest matching in bipartite graph G**
    - oldest problem in combinatorial algos 
    - there is an algorithm which solves this problem in poly time but we need NETWORK FLOWS for that!

- Maximum-Flow problem
    - intially motivated by issue of traffic in network and diversified applications seen later

- **Flow Networks** this is a directed graph with the features : *capacities* on each edge (indicating how much they can carry i.e., is non-negative), *source nodes* in the graph which generate traffic; *sink* which "absorbs" traffic as it arrives, and finally traffic is transmitted across the edges between internal nodes
    - Flow is an abstract entity generated at source and transmitted across edges and absorbed by sink.




### Reflection
We read about why the network flows and Max Flow problem which is pretty cool as it solves diverse set of problems!s
