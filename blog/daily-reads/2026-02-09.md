# Day 1 : Feb 8, 2026

## Two Pages Challenge

Today we start reading at least 2 pages daily no matter what. This is just a log for that.

### What I Read Today

Introduction to Compiler Construction

compiler means preserving transformation between languages, transforming a source language into a target language i.e., we basically defining a function that takes in a program in some source language and produces some program that "behaves same" in target language
our source language will be designed to remove restrictions from a target language, or add high-level features to improve usability
The behaviour of each language is defined by an interpreter. For x64, the behaviour is defined by whatever happens when we turn it into binary and run it on a CPU (The First Interpreter)
TODO: write programs that validate, analyze, and transform programs i.e., template and whole class of programs (i.e., set of instructions)
- Often, a higher-level language provides more convenient abstractions, making generating programs simpler. The language may already have an efficient implementation, making writing optimizations less important. This frees the compiler writer to focus on other design goals of the new source language. Perhaps they want to focus on ruling out more errors statically, or providing convenient syntax for certain programming patterns they find common. - COST such target come with their own implementations, compilers and run-time systems i.e., we restricted to use their toolchains which can be complicated + we cannot go to lower level of abstraction we estabilished a lower bound here, which may prevent implementing certain implementations :/

WHY higher-level language as target than assembly?
- we learn about low level transformations - easier to setup and dependencies management toolchain compared to C, LLVM or JS

WHY x64 is GOTATED target lang
- UNDERSTANDING x64 behaviour, abstractions, restrictions - note: x64 itself is a source language for binary machine code and it isnt available on all hardware i.e., may need an interpreter - The meaning of any program is simply the value or sequences values of each expression in the program - read same program in a language and then x64 to understand how transformation of register happens to execute same program - writing interpreter we basically formalizing the meaning of those transformations

### Reflection

Good first read, learnt how languages interact and different behaviour in each language will read more about writing interpreter next day
